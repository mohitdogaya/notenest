          Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Mohit Dogaya</strong>, a passionate Full Stack Developer
          specializing in the MERN stack. I enjoy building tools that solve real-world
          problems, and <strong>NoteNest</strong> is one of my personal projects created to
          help people organize their notes in a clean and efficient way.

        <h2>üìù Why I Built NoteNest</h2>
        <p>
          While learning full-stack development, I noticed that students and trainees
          (myself included!) often struggle to manage multiple notes and resources.
          I wanted to create a simple, fast, and visually appealing note-taking tool
          where users can securely store, edit, and organize their notes from anywhere.
        </p>

        <p>
          NoteNest is a full-stack web application built entirely from scratch using
          modern web development technologies. The process involved:

        <ul>
          <li>Designing a clean and user-friendly frontend interface</li>
          <li>Developing a secure and scalable backend API</li>
          <li>Integrating MongoDB for efficient data storage</li>
          <li>Adding authentication to protect user data</li>
